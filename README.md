# Fall Fishing : A Fall Themed Webfishing Custom Map
***Needs the lure mod installed as well, like most custom webfishing maps at the moment***

*Currently tested and confirmed to work on webfishing version v1.10*

Fall Fishing is a custom webfishing map that is a set of islands connected through bridges, while also of course being in Fall. This map uses some textures from the itch.io version of webfishing, and mainly uses assets already within webfishing to make sure the map can run smoothly on as many devices as possible 

The map is made up of 4 main islands, with some extra ones here and there. The island where you spawn is the main island, and is where you can find the following:
- Bait and Sell store
- Vending machine
- Quest board
- Dock shop
- aquarium cabin
- Frog NPC
- Opossum NPC
- Light House
- Chalk area
- permanent black hole that brings you to the void

Each island will also have their own bait and sell shops

Outside of that though, everything else is meant to be explored yourself.

**For updates on the map, and any other webfishing projects I work on, you can check out my twitter @SnailUSBs and bluesky @SnailUSB** This is my first webfishing map, so I wanted to do something a little more basic before jumping into more complex projects, plus I really wanted a fall map.

- Github:
- Thunderstore:

## Features
- Adds in an entirely new main map fall fishing, which is a few islands connected together using bridges. All NPCs, buildings, and stores are all here, alongside hidden spots for metal detectoring

- Adds a bounce mushroom path to the tutorial island.

- Adds in the unused boats and tents as props

- Alongside having all of the normal stores and buildings, I also made the a black hole that wont despawn unlike the normal one, so that way you can vist the void easil at anytime. Its beside the light, and the two npc stores. 

- Keeps the ocean and pond rock jumps.

- Keeps the light house, both of the other buildings, and all npcs. All of this is on the main island in the middle, which is where you spawn at. 

- Bushes, leaves, trees, and grass have been retextured to be in line with fall colors
