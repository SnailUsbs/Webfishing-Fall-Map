# Fall Fishing : A Fall Themed Webfishing Custom Map
***Needs the lure mod installed as well, like most custom webfishing maps at the moment***

*Currently tested and confirmed to work on webfishing version v1.10*

Fall Fishing is a custom Webfishing map consisting of a set of islands connected through bridges, all set in a Fall-themed environment. This map uses some textures from the itch.io version of webfishing, and outside of that primarily uses assets already within Webfishing to ensure smooth performance on as many devices as possible 

The map is made up of 4 main islands, The map is made up of four main islands, with some extra smaller ones scattered around. The island where you spawn is the main island, and is where you can find the following:
- Bait and Sell store
- Vending machine
- Quest board
- Dock shop
- aquarium cabin
- Frog NPC
- Opossum NPC
- Lighthouse
- Chalk area
- permanent black hole that brings you to the void

Each island will also have their own bait and sell shops

Outside of those things, everything else is meant to be explored on your own.

**For updates on the map, and any other webfishing projects I work on, you can check out my twitter @SnailUSBs and bluesky @SnailUSB** 

This is my first webfishing map, so I wanted to do something a little more basic before jumping into more complex projects, plus I really wanted a fall map.

- Adds a bounce mushroom path to the tutorial island.

- Adds in the unused boats and tents as props

- Adds a permanent black hole that won't despawn like the normal one, so you can visit the void easily at any time. Its beside the light, and the two npc stores. 

- Keeps the ocean and pond rock jumps.

- Keeps the light house, both of the other buildings, and all npcs. All of this is on the main island in the middle, which is where you spawn at.
