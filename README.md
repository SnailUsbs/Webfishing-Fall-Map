# Fall Fishing : A Fall Themed Webfishing Custom Map

Fall Fishing is a custom webfishing map that is a set of islands connected through bridges, while also of course being in Fall. This map uses some textures from the itch.io version of webfishing, and mainly uses assets already within webfishing to make sure the map can run smoothly on as many devices as possible 

***Needs the lure mod installed as well, like most custom webfishing maps at the moment***
*Currently tested and confirmed to work on webfishing versions v1.09 + v1.10*

The map is made up of 5 main islands, with some extra ones here and there. The island where you spawn is the main island, and is where you can find the following:
- Bait and Sell store
- Vending machine
- Quest board
- Dock shop
- aquarium cabin
- Frog NPC
- Opossum NPC
- Light House
- Chalk area
- permanent black hole that brings you to the void

Outside of that, everything else is meant to be explored yourself, but if you want a walk through of the map then you can watch this video on my youtube channel:

**For updates on the map, and any other webfishing projects I work on, you can check out my twitter and bluesky @SnailUSBs** This is my first webfishing map, so I wanted to do something a little more basic before jumping into more complex projects, plus I really wanted a fall map.
